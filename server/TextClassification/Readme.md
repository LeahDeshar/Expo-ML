# Spam Classification using Neural Networks

## 1. Data Preparation

- **Load Data**: Read a dataset containing text messages and their labels (spam or not spam).
- **Preprocess Text**: Tokenize and vectorize text data (e.g., using TF-IDF or word embeddings).
- **Label Encoding**: Convert labels (spam/not spam) into numerical format.
- **Split Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

## 2. Model Building

- **Neural Network Architecture**: Create a neural network suitable for text classification. Typically, this includes:
  - **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors if using word embeddings.
  - **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for learning complex patterns.
  - **Dropout Layers**: To prevent overfitting.
  - **Output Layer**: A final layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

## 3. Model Training

- **Compile the Model**: Set up the optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
- **Fit the Model**: Train the model using the training data and validate it using a validation set.

## 4. Model Evaluation

- **Evaluate Performance**: Test the model on the test data to check its accuracy and other metrics.

## 5. Visualization

- **Plot Metrics**: Visualize training and validation metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss) over epochs to assess the training process.
